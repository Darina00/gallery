React application to view the gallery and leave comments (not responsive, only desktop)
=====================

> The application is designed to work out modal windows.

    Data about pictures along with comments come from the [site](https://boiling-refuge-66454.herokuapp.com/images).
    When requesting a backend (POST), in case of ok, we get the status code 204 and the comment is not saved in the database.
    
    Link in the description of the repository.
